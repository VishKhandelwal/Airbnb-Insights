# Airbnb-Insights

This project is a comprehensive data analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City. Using Python and Power BI, I explored pricing trends, listing availability, and host engagement to uncover actionable insights for hosts, travelers, and stakeholders.

The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:
- ✅ **Overview of Listings**: Total listings, average price, service fee, availability
- 📍 **Pricing Insights**: Room-wise pricing, price vs reviews, top expensive neighborhoods
- 👤 **Host Analytics**: Top hosts by number of listings, reviews by room type
- 🗺️ **Listings Map**: Visualizing listings across boroughs

## 📁 Files Included
